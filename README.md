# QCQC
QCQC is a open source quantum chemistry software written in python3 and C/C++. The interface of python/C is realised by pybind11. 
The basis set is from basis_set_exchange project (https://github.com/MolSSI-BSE/basis_set_exchange)
The two-electron-integral evaluation is interfaced to Libint (https://github.com/search?q=libint).
Currently, I have only compiled the code under Anaconda3 environment.
